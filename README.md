| 5 |  16-20/4  | 10 | We started to work on the mechanics of the gun (M9) and assault rifle (AK47)

| 7 |  30/4-6/5  | 8 | It took us 6 hours to finish the build system, and 2 more hours to fix the problems we had with Git (we were having trouble merging our branches).
| 8 |  7-11 /5  | 8 | we started working on the zombie feature. We spent around 3 hours on it, but unfortunately, we are facing difficulties merging our branches. As a result, most of the week has been dedicated to solving these issues, taking approximately 5 hours. I believe that next week we will be able to resolve them and potentially finish the zombie scripts.
| 9 |  14-18/5  | 8 | We managed to resolve the Git problem. It took us about 2 hours. Then, we resumed working on the zombie system, which took us about 6 more hours. We believe that next week we will finish the zombie system.
| 10 |  19-26/5  | 7 | We finished the zombie system, and now we have started working on the "Hot Zone."https://github.com/ido7746/Zombie_Woods/assets/100276577/3e3948b4-563f-4d52-9379-063290966ba0
| 11 |  28-31/5  | 8 | We continue to work on the hot zone, where we have created an object resembling a torch spitting fire. At the start of the game, this object will appear, and supply drops will be dropping around it while zombies roam the area. Additionally, we have created a main menu. ![Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 15 44 16](https://github.com/ido7746/Zombie_Woods/assets/100276577/07f39d81-05bb-43ea-8567-dbd35662d0ba) ![Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 15 44 35](https://github.com/ido7746/Zombie_Woods/assets/100276577/e0557ae3-2fed-43a6-8187-8aa45f5e7e31) https://github.com/ido7746/Zombie_Woods/assets/100276577/a2843949-9845-41f8-8178-eca486d4a056
| 12 |  4-8/6  | 7 | We are continuing to work on the hot zone and have implemented a "coffee" model that acts as a speed boost. ![Screen Shot 2023-06-09 at 10 46 29](https://github.com/ido7746/Zombie_Woods/assets/100276577/02c971e8-2d8d-4236-89d9-d1033cbe6cbf) https://github.com/ido7746/Zombie_Woods/assets/100276577/33bda788-f048-4ab4-84f4-6e20237b9ec7
